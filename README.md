MOOSE (Multi-organ objective segmentation) a data-centric AI solution that generates multilabel organ segmentations to facilitate systemic TB whole-person research.The pipeline is based on nn-UNet and has the capability to segment 120 unique tissue classes from a whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT image.

## ⛔️ Hard requirements 

`MOOSE` has been *ONLY* tested on **Ubuntu linux OS**, with the following hardware capabilities:
- Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4216 CPU @ 2.10GHz 
- 256 GB of RAM (Very important for total-body datasets)
- 1 x Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti (or similar)
We are testing different configurations now, but the RAM (256 GB) seems to be a hard requirement. 

## ⚙️ Installation

### ‼️ ⚠️ NOTE: For people who already have the alpha version of moose in their servers 

If you have already installed `moose` before. You need to uninstall `moose` before installing the current version. This can be easily done by using the command below

#### Step: 1

```bash
sudo su
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
git clone https://github.com/QIMP-Team/MOOSE-v0.1.0.git
cd MOOSE-v0.1.0
bash moose_uninstaller.sh
```
Once these steps are done, follow the steps below to do a fresh install of `moose`.

#### Step: 2

```bash
bash moose_installer.sh
```
#### Step: 3

‼️ Source the .bashrc file again**

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 📀 Fresh install 

Kindly copy the code below and paste it on your ubuntu terminal, the installer should ideally take care of the rest. A fresh install would approximately take 10 minutes.

#### Step: 1

```bash

sudo su 
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
git clone https://github.com/QIMP-Team/MOOSE-v0.1.0.git
cd MOOSE-v0.1.0
bash moose_installer.sh
```

#### Step: 2

‼️ Source the .bashrc file again**

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 🗂 Required folder structure 

`moose` inherently performs batchwise analysis. Once you have all the patients to be analysed in a main directory, MOOSE performs the analysis sequentially. The output folders that will be created by the script itself are highlighted with the tag "Auto-generated" (refer results section). Organising the folder structure is the sole responsibility of the user. Also closely monitor the moose.log file for finding out more about the workflow of MOOSE. All the labels are stored under the 'labels' folder of each subject. 

```bash

main_folder/                         # The mother folder that holds all the patient folders (folder name can be anything)
├── SUB01                            # Individual patient folder (folder name can be anything)  
│   ├── AC_CT                        # Required: The CT folder name can be named anything as long as the files inside this folder is DICOM 
│   └── PET_WB                       # Required: The PT folder name can be named anything as long as the files inside this folder is DICOM          
└── SUB02
│   ├── AC_CT_1.2.752.37.47.345051852996.20220311.1441.5.430761
│   └── PET_WB_CORRECTED_1.2.752.37.47.345051852996.20220311.1441.5.430763

    └── PET_WB_CORRECTED_1.2.752.37.47.345051852996.20220311.1441.5.430763    
```

## 🖥 Usage

- For running the moose directly from the command-line terminal using the default options - please use the following command. In general, MOOSE performs the error analysis (refer paper) in similarity space and assumes that the given (if given) PET image is static.

```bash

#syntax:
moose -f path_to_main_folder 

#example: 
moose -f '/home/kyloren/Documents/main_folder'

```
## 📈 Results

After the analysis the following folders would be created.

```bash

main_folder/                         # The mother folder that holds all the patient folders (folder name can be anything)
├── SUB01                            # Individual patient folder (folder name can be anything)  
│   ├── AC_CT                        # Required: The CT folder name can be named anything as long as the files inside this folder is DICOM 
│   ├── MOOSE-SUB01                  # Auto-generated: All the files generated by MOOSE will be stored here
│   │   ├── CT                       # Auto-generated: The NIFTI CT file derived from the DICOM images will be stored here 
│   │   ├── labels                   # Auto-generated: All the generated labels will be stored here
│   │   │   └── sim_space            
│   │   │       └── similarity-space # Auto-generated: All the files generated during the error analysis  will be stored here
│   │   ├── PT                       # Auto-generated: The NIFTI PT file dereived from DICOM images will be stored here
│   │   └── temp                     # Auto-generated: Temporary folder for house-keeping                 
│   └── PET_WB                       # Required: The PT folder name can be named anything as long as the files inside this folder is DICOM

## 🙋 FAQ

**[1]** Will MOOSE only work on whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT datasets?

  *MOOSE ideally works on whole-body (head to toe) PET/CT datasets, but also works on semi whole-body PET/CT datasets (head to pelvis). Unfortunately, we haven't tested other field-of-views. We will post the evaluations soon.*


**[2]** Will MOOSE only work on multimodal 18F-FDG PET/CT datasets or can it also be applied to CT only? or PET only?

 *MOOSE automatically infers the modality type using the DICOM header tags. MOOSE builds the entire atlas with 120 tissues if the user provides multimodal 18F-FDG PET/CT datasets. The user can also provide CT only DICOM folder, MOOSE will infer the modality type and segment only the non-cerebral tissues (36/120 tissues) and will not segment the 83 subregions of the brain. MOOSE will definitely not work if only provided with 18F-FDG PET images.*


**[3]** Will MOOSE work on non-DICOM formats?

 *Unfortunately the current version accepts only DICOM formats. In the future, we will try to enable non-DICOM formats for processing as well.*

## 🛠 To do: 
- [x] Create a working `moose_uninstaller.sh `
- [ ] Create a docker image for the current version of moose v0.1.0
