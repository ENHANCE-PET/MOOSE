## MOOSE 2.0 🫎 - Leaner. Meaner. Stronger 💪

Unveiling a new dimension in 3D medical image segmentation: MOOSE 2.0 🚀

Crafted meticulously from the core principles of data-centric AI, MOOSE 2.0 is our response to the demands of both preclinical and clinical imaging. 

✨ It's Leaner: We've hacked away the fluff and made MOOSE 2.0 leaner than ever before. This bad boy doesn't need heavy-duty computing. With less than 32GB of RAM, compatibility across OS, and the flexibility to work with or without NVIDIA GPUs, MOOSE 2.0 fits right into any environment. 🔬

💥 It's Meaner: Our engineers have poured their hearts and souls into building this beast from scratch. With the speed clocking 5x faster than its predecessor, MOOSE 2.0 cuts through the noise and gets down to business instantly. It serves up a range of segmentation models designed for both clinical and preclinical settings. No more waiting, no more compromises. It's Mean Machine time! ⚡

🔥 It's Stronger: MOOSE 2.0 is powered by the sheer strength of Data-centric AI principles. With a whopping 2.5k datasets, that's x times more data than our first model, we're packing a punch. MOOSE 2.0 comes with the strength and knowledge gained from an array of data that's simply unparalleled. The result? Better precision, improved outcomes, and a tool you can trust. 💼

Accommodating an array of modalities including PET, CT, and MRI, MOOSE 2.0 stands at the cusp of a paradigm shift. It’s not just an upgrade; it’s our commitment to making MOOSE 2.0 your go-to for segmentation tasks.

Join us as we embark on this journey.
