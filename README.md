## Usage Guide 📚

### Command-line tool for batch processing :computer: 

Embarking on your journey with MOOSE 2.0 is straightforward and easy. Our command-line tool for batch processing requires only two arguments: the directory path where your subject images are stored, and the segmentation model name you wish to use. Here's how you can get started:

```bash
moosez -d <path_to_image_dir> -m <model_name>
```

Here `<path_to_image_dir>` refers to the directory containing your subject images and `<model_name>` is the name of the segmentation model you intend to utilize. 

For instance, to perform clinical CT organ segmentation, the command would be:

```bash
moosez -d <path_to_image_dir> -m clin_ct_organs
```

In this example, 'clin_ct_organs' is the segmentation model name for clinical CT organ segmentation.

And that's it! With just one command, you're all set to explore the new horizons of 3D medical image segmentation with MOOSE 2.0.

Need assistance along the way? Don't worry, we've got you covered. Simply type:

```bash
moosez -h
```

This command will provide you with all the help and the information about the available [models](https://github.com/QIMP-Team/MOOSE/blob/3fcfad710df790e29a4a1ea16f22e480f784f38e/moosez/resources.py#L29) and the [regions](https://github.com/QIMP-Team/MOOSE/blob/3fcfad710df790e29a4a1ea16f22e480f784f38e/moosez/constants.py#L64) it segments.

### Using MOOSE 2.0 as a Library :books:

MOOSE 2.0 can also be imported and used as a library in your own Python projects. Here's how you can do it:

First, import the `moose` function from the `moosez` package in your python script:

 ```python
 from moosez import moose
 ```

Then, call the `moose` function to run predictions. The `moose` function takes four arguments:

1. `model_name`: The name of the model to use for the predictions.
2. `input_dir`: The directory containing the images (in nifti, either .nii or .nii.gz) to process.
3. `output_dir`: The directory where the output will be saved.
4. `accelerator`: The type of accelerator to use (e.g., "cpu", "cuda").

Here's an example of how to call the `moose` function:

 ```python
 model_name = 'clin_ct_organs'
 input_dir = '/home/Documents/your_project/data/input'
 output_dir = '/home/Documents/your_project/data/output'
 accelerator = 'cuda'
 moose(model_name, input_dir, output_dir, accelerator)
 ```

Remember to replace `model_name`, `input_dir`, `output_dir`, and `accelerator` with the actual values you want to use.

That's it! MOOSE 2.0 will now process the images in the input directory and save the output in the output directory. Enjoy using MOOSE 2.0 as a library in your Python projects!

## Directory Structure and Naming Conventions for MOOSE 📂🏷️

### Applicable only for batch mode ⚠️

Using MOOSE 2.0 optimally requires your data to be structured according to specific conventions. MOOSE 2.0 supports both DICOM and NIFTI formats. For DICOM files, MOOSE infers the modality from the DICOM tags and checks if the given modality is suitable for the chosen segmentation model. However, for NIFTI files, users need to ensure that the files are named with the correct modality as a suffix.

### Required Directory Structure 🌳
Please structure your dataset as follows:

```
MOOSEv2_data/
├── S1
│   ├── AC-CT
│   │   ├── WBACCTiDose2_2001_CT001.dcm
│   │   ├── WBACCTiDose2_2001_CT002.dcm
│   │   ├── .
│   │   ├── .
│   │   ├── .
│   │   └── WBACCTiDose2_2001_CT532.dcm
│   └── AC-PT
│       ├── DetailWB_CTACWBPT001_PT001.dcm
│       ├── DetailWB_CTACWBPT001_PT002.dcm
│       ├── .
│       ├── .
│       ├── .
│       └── DetailWB_CTACWBPT001_PT532.dcm
├── S2
│   └── CT_S2.nii
├── S3
│   └── CT_S3.nii
├── S4
│   └── S4_ULD_FDG_60m_Dynamic_Patlak_HeadNeckThoAbd_20211025075852_2.nii
└── S5
    └── CT_S5.nii
```
**Note:** If the necessary naming conventions are not followed, MOOSE 2.0 will skip the subjects.

### Naming Conventions for NIFTI files 📝
When using NIFTI files, you should name the file with the appropriate modality as a suffix. 

For instance, if you have chosen the `model_name` as `clin_ct_organs`, the CT scan for subject 'S2' in NIFTI format, should have the modality tag 'CT_' attached to the file name, e.g. `CT_S2.nii`. In the directory shown above, every subject will be processed by `moosez` except S4.

**Remember:** Adhering to these file naming and directory structure conventions ensures smooth and efficient processing with MOOSE 2.0. Happy segmenting! 🚀

## A Note on QIMP Python Packages: The 'Z' Factor 📚🚀

All of our Python packages here at QIMP carry a special signature – a distinctive 'Z' at the end of their names. The 'Z' is more than just a letter to us; it's a symbol of our forward-thinking approach and commitment to continuous innovation.

Our MOOSE package, for example, is named as 'moosez', pronounced "moose-see". So, why 'Z'?

Well, in the world of mathematics and science, 'Z' often represents the unknown, the variable that's yet to be discovered, or the final destination in a series. We at QIMP believe in always pushing boundaries, venturing into uncharted territories, and staying on the cutting edge of technology. The 'Z' embodies this philosophy. It represents our constant quest to uncover what lies beyond the known, to explore the undiscovered, and to bring you the future of medical imaging.

Each time you see a 'Z' in one of our package names, be reminded of the spirit of exploration and discovery that drives our work. With QIMP, you're not just installing a package; you're joining us on a journey to the frontiers of medical image processing. Here's to exploring the 'Z' dimension together! 🚀
