The 'Z' Factor in QIMP Packages
===============================

At QIMP, every Python package dons a 'Z' - a symbol of our avant-garde approach and a commitment to ceaseless innovation.

The 'Z' isn't a mere alphabet for us. In the realms of math and science, 'Z' signifies the unknown or the culmination of a series. It epitomizes our spirit to venture beyond the known and discover the uncharted. 

Each 'Z' is an invitation - to venture, discover, and redefine the horizons of medical image processing with us.
