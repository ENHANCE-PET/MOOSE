# Description:
# This module contains the urls and filenames of the models and binaries that are required for the moosez.
#
# Usage:
# The variables in this module can be imported and used in other modules within the moosez to download the necessary
# binaries and models for the moosez.

# This list contains the unique identifiers for all available pre-trained models.
# To make your model available, add its unique identifier to this list.
# The model name or the unique identifier has a specific syntax:
# 'clin' or 'preclin' (indicating Clinical or Preclinical),
# modality tag (like 'ct', 'pt', 'mr'), and then the tissue of interest.

AVAILABLE_MODELS = ["clin_ct_lungs",

# This dictionary holds the pre-trained models available in MooseZ library.
# Each key is a unique model identifier following a specific syntax mentioned above
# It should have the same name mentioned in AVAILABLE_MODELS list.
# Each value is a dictionary containing the following keys:
#    - url: The URL where the model files can be downloaded.
#    - filename: The filename of the model's zip file.
#    - directory: The directory where the model files will be extracted.
#    - trainer: The type of trainer used to train the model.
#    - voxel_spacing: The voxel spacing used in the model in the form [x, y, z], this is basically the median voxel
#    spacing generated by nnunetv2, and you can find this in the plans.json file of the model.
#    - multilabel_prefix: A prefix to distinguish between different types of labels in multi-label models.
#
# To include your own model, add a new entry to this dictionary following the above format.
