"""

This module contains the constants that are used in the moosez.

Constants are values that are fixed and do not change during the execution of a program. 
They are used to store values that are used repeatedly throughout the program, such as 
file paths, folder names, and display parameters.

This module contains the following constants:

- `ALLOWED_MODALITIES`: A constant that stores a list of allowed modalities for the moosez algorithm.

- `ANSI_ORANGE`: A constant that stores the ANSI color code for orange.
- `ANSI_GREEN`: A constant that stores the ANSI color code for green.
- `ANSI_VIOLET`: A constant that stores the ANSI color code for violet.
- `ANSI_RESET`: A constant that stores the ANSI color code for resetting the color.

- `SEGMENTATIONS_FOLDER`: A constant that stores the name of the folder that contains the segmentations generated by 
                          the moosez algorithm.
- `STATS_FOLDER`: A constant that stores the name of the folder that contains the statistics generated by 
                  the moosez algorithm.

- `INTERPOLATION`: A constant that stores the interpolation method used by the moosez algorithm.
- `CHUNK_THRESHOLD`: A constant that stores the chunk threshold used by the moosez algorithm.

- `MIP_ROTATION_STEP`: A constant that stores the MIP rotation step used by the moosez algorithm.
- `DISPLAY_VOXEL_SPACING`: A constant that stores the display voxel spacing used by the moosez algorithm.
- `FRAME_DURATION`: A constant that stores the frame duration used by the moosez algorithm.

This module is imported by other modules in the moosez package and the constants are used throughout the package 
to provide fixed values that are used repeatedly.
